Knowledge holds the documents your team and your agents rely on: policies, procedures, product facts, boilerplate. Agents search it before they answer, so a reply quotes your real return policy instead of a guess.

Search matches the words a document contains. When someone asks in another language than your documents, the agent searches with the key terms translated into the documents' language, and when a search finds nothing it tries again in English.

## Write a document

1. Click **Knowledge** in the activity bar.
2. Click **New document** in the sidebar.
3. Give it a title and write the body. Click **Save**.

The sidebar has two trees: **Personal** for your own notes and **Shared with org** for team documents. Use **New personal folder**, **New shared folder** or **New folder** to make folders, and **Move to** to file a document. Documents in no folder are under **Unfiled**. Deleting a folder keeps the documents inside it.

You can also click **Create knowledge from…** on the Knowledge home to ask your agent to write documents from material you give it.

If someone else saves the document while you edit it, Liaison tells you and offers **Load the latest version**.

## Share a document

1. Open the document and click **Share**.
2. Under **General access**, choose one:
   - **Restricted**: only people with access
   - **Anyone in the org can view**
   - **Anyone in the org can edit**
   - **C-Level**: everyone in the organization can view, only C-Level can edit
3. Under **People with access**, click **Add people…** and choose **Viewer** or **Editor** for each person.
4. Under **Roles with access**, click **Add roles…** to share with a whole role.
5. Click **Save**.

Admins have no bypass: a restricted document is editable only by its owner or someone with an **Editor** share. Search follows the same sharing rules, so a document not shared with you does not appear in your results or your agent's.

## Sync a Google Drive folder

A synced source mounts an external folder so its files appear as read-only Knowledge documents that stay fresh. Google Drive is the folder source you can add from settings. Connect [Google Drive](google-drive.md) first.

1. Open **Settings › Apps › Knowledge**, section **Synced sources**.
2. Click **+ Add source**.
3. Paste the **Drive folder ID**. Open the folder in Drive and copy the id from the URL after `drive.google.com/drive/folders/`.
4. Enter a **Display name**, for example "Product manual", and a **Sync interval (minutes)**.
5. Choose the **Scope**: **Personal** or **Shared with org**. Shared needs `knowledge:sources:manage` or `knowledge:documents:admin` (an admin holding every scope has both).
6. Choose the **Sensitivity**: internal, confidential, restricted or public.
7. Click **Add source**.

Through the organization's Drive connection, a folder syncs only when it sits in one of the shared drives an admin picked ([Google Drive](google-drive.md#share-the-organizations-shared-drives)); a folder in someone's My Drive syncs through that person's own connection. When one Google account is both the organization's Drive and a person's own, an organization folder syncs through the organization's connection and that person's own folders through theirs. A folder of the organization's Drive is hidden while no shared drive is picked, and deleted from Knowledge at its next sync when it is in none of the picked drives; the source says why.

A Drive connected in picked mode (a personal Google account, see [Google Drive](google-drive.md#choose-the-files-liaison-sees)) adds its source by itself, **Google Drive: <address>**, holding the files and folders picked with **Choose files**. The **Files Liaison can see in Google Drive** card sits above **Add source** on this page, so you can pick more files from here.

Text files (plain text, Markdown, CSV, JSON, XML, YAML), Google Docs, Slides and Sheets, and Excel workbooks (.xlsx, each sheet as CSV) become documents. Other files, such as PDFs and images, become links in a source shared with the organization and are left out of a personal one; the sync then names the files it left out instead of reporting a plain success.

Documents from a source marked confidential or restricted are readable only by the person who added the source and the people and roles they are shared with, not by the whole organization.

Synced documents show **Synced from** with the last refresh time and a **Refresh** button. The **Synced sources** list shows each source, where it comes from (Google Drive, GitLab or Database) and who it is shared with. Click **Sync now** to sync one at once, or archive it to stop syncing. Its documents stay when you stop.

In the [live demo](../getting-started/demo.md), the GitLab and Google Drive sources are seeded with their documents and do not sync: the demo has no connected accounts.

An agent can also bring in a GitLab repository path or the connected database's knowledge base with `knowledge__add_folder_source`. For GitLab, see [GitLab](gitlab.md).

## Keep documents verified

1. On the Knowledge home, click **Needs review** to see documents that are flagged, stale, missing an owner or past their review date.
2. Open a document, check it, and click **Verify**.

Use **Archive** to retire a document and **Restore** to bring it back.

## Import collections and documents

Collections import as the `knowledge.collection` kind and documents as the `knowledge.document` kind, each matched on its `externalRef`: one imported before is skipped, never updated. In a run with both, collections go first, so a document can be filed in a collection the same run creates (`collectionRefs`).

An imported document follows the same rules as one you write: its sensitivity sets who in the organization can open it (**Confidential** and **Restricted** documents start shared with nobody), and you can only import a sensitivity or a team you have access to. Tags are matched on their name; an existing tag is reused as it is. Attachments are copies of files you uploaded. A personal document can belong to another person (`ownerEmail`) when you can assign document owners.

Importing documents needs `knowledge:documents:create` (and `knowledge:tags:manage` to tag them), importing collections `knowledge:collections:manage`. Each import is a run you can undo from **Settings › Organization › Imports** (see [Undo an import](../admin/settings.md#undo-an-import)).

## Roles and scopes

Knowledge ships three roles. See [roles](../admin/roles.md).

| Role | Scopes |

| `admin` | `knowledge:documents:admin`, `knowledge:cache:manage` |

`knowledge:approve` decides any Knowledge approvals. Full list: [scope reference](../reference/scopes.md).
